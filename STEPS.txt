These are the detailed steps for your reference


1) Installing the Git from the git clone

    		git clone git://github.com/wholly/integrity.git 

2) Now following the steps in the github, firstly installing the sinatra gem

     (i) To Install sinatra, you need to have rack 

               gem install rack

     (ii) Now go ahead to install the sinatra gem
   
                gem install sinatra-sinatra -s http://gems.github.com

     (iii) Also, Make Sure that you have the following gems installed on your machine
   				
				dm-core 
				dm-types
				dm-timestamps 
				dm-serializer 
				dm-observer 
				dm-migrations 
				dm-is-tree 
				dm-cli 
				dm-aggregates 
				dm-validations
  				thor -v=0.9.9 

3) Next with thin and sqlite adapters (as mysql is not working with Integrity yet) and oauth
     
				gem install thin do_sqlite3
				
				gem install oauth
				
				gem install -s http://gems.github.com jstewart-yammer4r (* if you would like to have notifiers to YAMMER)
				
4) Copy the sample configurations file as a config.ru 

				cp config/config.sample.ru config/config.ru
				
5) Now the db yml file as well and change the settings according to your needs and also the paths in the file for builds and logs

				cp config/config.sample.yml config/config.yml

6)  Db Migrate step
 		
				bin/integrity migrate_db config/config.yml 			

7) make sure these directories exist :
    (i)   :export_directory --> The directory path which you have specified in config.yml
    (ii)  /tmp/integrity-exports/cache
				
8) Starting the server
				
				thin -C config/config.yml -R config/config.ru start
				
**This is what worked for me (make sure all path variables are added)
~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/thin   -C config/config.yml -R config/config.ru start
(Add bin to your paths)

**NOTE: IN CASE IF THERE ARE ANY ERRORS AND YOU WISH TO DEBUG PLS GO AHEAD AND START THE SERVER AS

				bin/integrity launch

9) starting with new Project

    open localhost:3000  ( default port is 3000)

 and create a new project and click on Manual Build. It doesn't give you any signs of the process being completed, upon returning to the projects page, you will find the details of the build

STEPS TO GENERATE THE KEYS FOR THE YAMMER

1) Register your application with the "https://www.yammer.com/client_applications/new"

 		In here you are given with the following format:
   


		OAuth details for XXXXXX
		Consumer (Application) Key: 	hfv5z5qf5Rd442UgCEstQ
		Consumer (Application) Secret: 	4CkdgtmQKj1VxqqPab8c7tHK1oU38spzGmNzRFQ
		Request Token URL 	https://www.yammer.com/oauth/request_token
		Access Token URL 	https://www.yammer.com/oauth/access_token
		Authorize URL 	https://www.yammer.com/oauth/authorize

		We support HMAC-SHA1 (recommended) as well as plain text in SSL mode.

2) Uncomment the lines in the config.ru lines 4 & 6

2) use the script in the yammer_create_oauth_yml.rb which you can find in the /vendor/yammer4r/bin director and follow the instructions as in the file to get the access token and access secret 


3)  Restart the integrity application and start using the yammer notifier
